# Ohypnosis

### Background

Ohypnosis is a self-hypnosis app designed to provide users with an accessible and effective tool for self-improvement and mindfulness through hypnosis.

### My Role

In my role as the user experience designer for Ohypnosis, I took on a comprehensive set of responsibilities that spanned the entirety of the design process. I conducted desk research and safaris to gather insights into the market and user behavior, defined the UX requirements based on my findings, and implemented usability tests to refine our approach. Beyond the user experience design, I also took charge of designing the visuals and branding for Ohypnosis. This included developing the logo, color scheme, typography, and overall visual identity that would resonate with our target audience and communicate the app's core values and benefits.

### Design Process

My design process was thorough and methodical, involving several key stages:

1. **Desk Research:** I started with extensive desk research to understand the landscape of self-hypnosis and mindfulness apps. This helped me identify trends, opportunities, and challenges within the market.

2. **Safari:** I conducted safaris, observing users in environments where they might use Ohypnosis or similar apps. This hands-on research provided valuable insights into real-world usage scenarios and user needs.

3. **Persona Development:** Based on my research, I created detailed personas representing our target users. These personas guided my design decisions, ensuring they were user-centered.

4. **Stakeholderâ€™s Map and Business Model Canvas:** I mapped out stakeholders and used a business model canvas to align the project with broader business objectives. This ensured that my UX and branding efforts contributed to the app's success in a meaningful way.

5. **Venn Diagram:** I employed Venn diagrams to identify and visualize the overlap between user needs, business goals, and technological capabilities, ensuring a balanced approach to the app design.

6. **Wireframes and Prototype:** With a solid foundation of research and strategy, I developed wireframes and a prototype. This iterative process allowed me to explore different design solutions and refine the user interface and experience based on feedback from usability tests.

7. **Test:** Conducting usability tests was crucial for validating my design decisions and making data-driven improvements. This feedback loop helped enhance the app's usability and overall user satisfaction.

8. **Branding:** In addition to the UX design, I was also responsible for the branding of Ohypnosis. This involved creating a visual identity that communicated the app's essence and appealed to our target audience. The branding work was integral to the project, encompassing the design of the app's logo, color scheme, typography, and other visual elements that together created a cohesive and attractive look and feel.

Through this comprehensive design process, I aimed to create a self-hypnosis app that was not only effective and user-friendly but also visually appealing and emotionally resonant. My work on Ohypnosis combined strategic thinking, creative design, and user-centered practices to deliver an app that empowers users to achieve their self-improvement goals through hypnosis.
